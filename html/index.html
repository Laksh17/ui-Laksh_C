    			<h2>Brief Intro</h2>
    			One of the most infamous and dreadful pandemics of all time, COVID-19, was initially reported by China as 'widespread Pneumonia cases' on 31st December, 2019. This virus is said to have originated from bats which were sold in many wet markets of China. Consumption of these animals proved to be fatal as the virus was able to cause havock to the human body in similar ways as that of the SARS virus. This virus spread even to people who weren't near any animal, let alone consume it. This became conclusive proof that this virus <span id="important">spreads through air and also through contact with an infected person.</span> But due to late realisation of the severity of the virus, most of the infected Chinese travellers had already been to many other parts of the world thereby, unknowingly infecting many other people as this virus is very contagious.

    						<h3>Coughing and Sneezing</h3>
    						<p>When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus. These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur. This is especially concerning when the infected person</p>
