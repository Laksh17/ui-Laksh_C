    			<h2>Brief Intro</h2>
    			One of the most infamous and dreadful pandemics of all time, COVID-19, was initially reported by China as 'widespread Pneumonia cases' on 31st December, 2019. This virus is said to have originated from bats which were sold in many wet markets of China. Consumption of these animals proved to be fatal as the virus was able to cause havock to the human body in similar ways as that of the SARS virus. This virus spread even to people who weren't near any animal, let alone consume it. This became conclusive proof that this virus <span id="important">spreads through air and also through contact with an infected person.</span> But due to late realisation of the severity of the virus, most of the infected Chinese travellers had already been to many other parts of the world thereby, unknowingly infecting many other people as this virus is very contagious.

    			<p>The virus and the unfavourable situations caused by the virus have taken a toll on the entire world. This pandemic has hit the world in more than one way. Here is a brief look at most of the crisis created.</p>

    						<h3>On Health</h3>
    						<p>COVID-19 can cause a range of symptoms of wildly varying severity in people. Some might be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, while others are sick enough to need hospitalisation, supplementary oxygen and the use of a ventilator. Broadly, as a respiratory virus, COVID-19 causes breathlessness, fatigue</p>
    						</figure>
    						<figure class="back-2">
    						<p>and muscle ache. Some people have reported gut issues and problems with their kidneys. Severe COVID-19 patients have experienced what’s called a ‘cytokine storm’ in which the body’s immune system goes into a potentially fatal overdrive and leads to multi-organ failure.</p>
