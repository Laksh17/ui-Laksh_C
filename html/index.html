    			<h2>Brief Intro</h2>
    			One of the most infamous and dreadful pandemics of all time, COVID-19, was initially reported by China as 'widespread Pneumonia cases' on 31st December, 2019. This virus is said to have originated from bats which were sold in many wet markets of China. Consumption of these animals proved to be fatal as the virus was able to cause havock to the human body in similar ways as that of the SARS virus. This virus spread even to people who weren't near any animal, let alone consume it. This became conclusive proof that this virus <span id="important">spreads through air and also through contact with an infected person.</span> But due to late realisation of the severity of the virus, most of the infected Chinese travellers had already been to many other parts of the world thereby, unknowingly infecting many other people as this virus is very contagious.

    						<h3>Coughing and Sneezing</h3>
    						<p>When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus. These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur. This is especially concerning when the infected person</p>

    			<h2>Effects</h2>
    			<p>The virus and the unfavourable situations caused by the virus have taken a toll on the entire world. This pandemic has hit the world in more than one way. Here is a brief look at most of the crisis created.</p>

    						<h3>On Health</h3>
    						<p>COVID-19 can cause a range of symptoms of wildly varying severity in people. Some might be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, while others are sick enough to need hospitalisation, supplementary oxygen and the use of a ventilator. Broadly, as a respiratory virus, COVID-19 causes breathlessness, fatigue</p>
    						</figure>
    						<figure class="back-2">
    						<p>and muscle ache. Some people have reported gut issues and problems with their kidneys. Severe COVID-19 patients have experienced what’s called a ‘cytokine storm’ in which the body’s immune system goes into a potentially fatal overdrive and leads to multi-organ failure.</p>

    						<h3>On Economic activities</h3>
    						<p>Due to the fall in travel, global industrial activity has been affected. Oil prices fell further in March as the transportation section was hit due to several countries imposing lockdowns.IMF projects a decrease in food prices by 2.6 per cent in 2020,</p>

    						<p>caused by supply chain disruptions, border delays, food security concerns in regions affected by Covid-19 and export restrictions.Due to lockdowns in China, followed by in the US and Europe, the demand for industrial metals reduced as factories shut down. As per IMF, China accounts for roughly half of the global demand for industrial metals.</p>

    			<h2>Symptoms</h2>
    			<p>The most commonly used method for detecting whether one has contracted a virus is to check for any symptoms/sickness present in your body. Note that these symptoms can indicate a lot of diseases/viruses and not necessarily COVID-19. But it is still important to know about the symptoms as they aid you in taking the decision of getting a checkup or not.</p>
